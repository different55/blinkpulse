# BlinkPulse

A music visualizer for the BlinkStick adapted from Will Yager's LED music visualizer project: http://yager.io/LEDStrip/LED.html

Finds the loudest frequency, assigns it a hue according to its frequency and a brightness according to its loudness and creates a scrolling log of these colors. Looks good even with few LEDs, although with lots of LEDs (lke the Flex) you might want to turn on looping (it's on by default).
